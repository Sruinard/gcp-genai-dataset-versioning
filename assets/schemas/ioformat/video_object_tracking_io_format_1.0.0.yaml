        timeOffset:
          type: string
          description: >
            A time (frame) of a video in which the object has been detected.
            Expressed as a number of seconds as measured from the
            start of the video, with fractions up to a microsecond precision,
            and with "s" appended at the end.
        instanceId:
          type: number
          format: integer
          description: >
            The instance of the object, expressed as a positive integer. Used to

  dataItemResourceLabels:
    description: >
      Resource labels on the DataItem. Overrides values set in
      ImportDataConfig at import time. Can set a user-defined label
      or the predefined `aiplatform.googleapis.com/ml_use` label, which is
